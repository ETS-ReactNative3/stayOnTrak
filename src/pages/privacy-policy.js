          THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE SITE’S <a href="/terms-of-use/">TERMS OF USE</a>, GOVERN YOUR USE OF THIS SITE, 
            AND OUR USE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOUR USE OF IT. BY USING THE SITE, YOU AGREE 
            TO THE TERMS OF THE PRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY 
            POLICY OR THE TERMS OF USE, YOU CANNOT USE THE SITE. IF YOU ARE ELIGIBLE TO ENROLL, OR ARE ENROLLED, 
            IN THE ONTRAK PROGRAM, YOUR USE OF THE SITE IS ALSO GOVERNED BY OUR <a href="/hipaa/">HIPAA NOTICE</a>, WHICH PROVIDES 
            IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT HOW WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR PHI. CONTINUED USE OF THE ONTRAK WEBSITE,

          <p><strong>Welcome Message and Overview.</strong> Welcome! You have arrived at <a href="https://stayontrak.com">StayOnTrak.com</a>, 
            a website that is provided by <strong>Catasys, Inc.</strong>, (“Company” or “we,” “our” or “us”).  As a shorthand, we sometimes 
            refer to StayOnTrak.com and any other site, including mobile and internet versions, that posts a link to this Privacy Policy as the “Site."</p>

          <p>We understand that health is a very personal, private subject. For this reason, we developed this Privacy Policy 
            (“Privacy Policy”) to explain how we collect, use and share information about you when you visit or use our Site. 
            This Privacy Policy also explains how we protect your privacy with respect to information that you choose to provide 
            to us through the Site. If you are enrolled in our OnTrak Program or eligible for it through your health plan, the 
            information you share with us has additional protections and you have additional rights under federal and state law 
            with respect to access, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable information that constitutes PHI. Specifically, 
            under a federal law called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations 
            (“HIPAA”) and similar state laws, some of the personally identifiable information that we collect on the Site is considered 
            “protected health information," or “PHI," as those terms are defined by HIPAA. In general, PHI is personally identifiable 
            information that we receive directly from you or from your health plan or other health care providers. PHI also includes 
            information that we create, receive, transmit, or maintain while delivering services to you through our OnTrak Program.</p>  

          <p>With regard to information that we collect before you enroll in the OnTrak Program, we may collect information on this Site 
            that concerns or is relevant to (a) your past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition, (b) the provision 
            of health care to you, or (c) your past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care. We will use this 
            information to help us determine if you are eligible for the OnTrak Program. All of this information is PHI for HIPAA purposes. 
            If we collect information from you through this Site for other purposes, then we may still treat this information as “sensitive 
            health information”, which means that we take commercially reasonable steps that are described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy 
            to protect it from use or disclosure without your express consent. To the extent the terms of this Privacy Policy conflict with 
            our obligation under HIPAA, we will protect your PHI in compliance with HIPAA; all other information will be used and disclosed 
            in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>

          <p>If you use the Site on another person’s behalf (such as a family member) or an entity (such as your employer), you represent that 
            you are authorized by that person or entity to accept this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use on that person’s or entity’s behalf.</p>

          <h2 id="1">WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT ME IS COLLECTED?</h2>
          <h3>Personal Information and Demographic Information</h3>
          <p>
          “Personal Information” is information like your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and other 
          information that can be used to identify or contact you. Certain areas of our Site allow you to submit Personal Information 
          or demographic information, such as information about your gender and age (“Demographic Information”). We use Personal 
          Information and Demographic Information to send you requested information, respond to your inquiry, improve our Site, 
          verify your relationship with us, enroll you in the OnTrak Program, deliver services through the OnTrak Program and take 
          other actions that may be necessary to respond to your request.
          </p>

          <h3>Usage Information</h3>
          <p>
          In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Site, we and our 
          third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect and store 
          certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Site (“<strong>Usage Information</strong>”). This Usage Information may be 
          stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, 
          tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “<strong>Device</strong>”) whenever you visit or interact with our Site. Usage Information may 
          be non‑identifying or may be associated with you. Whenever we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information, 
          we will treat it as Personal Information (and as PHI as required). This Usage Information may include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>your IP address, UDID or other unique identifier (“<strong>Device Identifier</strong>”). A Device Identifier is a number that is 
                automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Site, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;</li><br />
            <li>your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);</li><br />
            <li>the URL that referred you to our Site;</li><br />
            <li>the areas within our Site that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences;</li><br />
            <li>your Device location;</li><br />
            <li>your Device characteristics; and</li><br />
            <li>certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We may use various methods and technologies to collect and store Usage Information (“<strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>”). Tracking Technologies 
            may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device. A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without 
            limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):
          </p>

          <p><strong><em>Cookies</em></strong>. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) 
            is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 
            cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage.  Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies 
            may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances 
            can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers 
            offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 
            cookies.  For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s web site www.adobe.com. Please be aware that if you disable or 
            remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of our Site may not function properly, and that when you 
            revisit our Site your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
          </p> 

          <p><strong><em>Web Beacons</em></strong>. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) 
            may be included in our Site’s pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code 
            inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, 
            without limitation, to count visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually 
            opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
          </p>

          <p><strong><em>Embedded Scripts</em></strong>. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions 
            with the Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third-party service provider,
            is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
          </p>  

          <p><strong><em>Browser Fingerprinting</em></strong>. Collection and analysis of information from your Device, such as, without limitation, 
            your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.
          </p> 

          <p><strong><em>ETag, or entity tag</em></strong>. A feature of the cache in browsers.  It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a 
            specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in 
            this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash 
            and/or HTML5 cookies.
          </p> 

          <p><strong><em>Recognition Technologies</em></strong>. Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt 
            to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user).
          </p> 

          <p>We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:</p>

          <p><strong><em>Strictly Necessary</em></strong>. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to 
            allow you to use and access our Site, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of 
            Site functionality.
          </p>

          <p><strong><em>Performance‑Related</em></strong>. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the 
           performance of the Site, including as part of our analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered 
           through the Site.
          </p>

          <p><strong><em>Functionality‑Related</em></strong>. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are required to offer you enhanced 
           functionality when accessing the Site, including identifying you when you visit our Site or keeping track of our specified preferences, 
           including in terms of the presentation of content on our Site.
          </p>

          <p><strong><em>Targeting‑Related</em></strong>. We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content relevant to your interests on our Site 
           and third‑party sites based on how you interact with our content.  This includes using Tracking Technologies to understand the usefulness 
           to you of the content that have been delivered to you.
          </p>

          <p>There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Site. Further, third parties may 
           use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Site, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over 
           time and across third-party web sites or online services.  We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for 
           them. However, you consent to potentially encountering third-party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Site and accept 
           that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.
          </p>

          <h3>Non-Personal Information</h3>
          <p>We also collect Non-Personal Information through our Internet log files, which record data such as user IP addresses, browser types, 
           domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of the Site. This information may be used to analyze trends, to 
           administer and monitor the use of the Site, and to gather general demographic information.
          </p>

          <h3>Interactions with Third-Party Services</h3>
          <p>The Site may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Site and your account on a third-party web 
            site, application or other service. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, 
            including Personal Information, to us. For example, we may provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the Site to facilitate 
            your sending a communication from the Site. For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, Tweets or Facebook postings. 
            These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’ 
            practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy. We may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties. 
            Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible 
            for their practices. You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Site.
          </p>

          <h3>Information You Provide About a Third-Party</h3>
          <p>You may be able to send a communication from the Site to someone other than us.  In these circumstances, we only use the information you 
            provide (names, email addresses, mobile number, etc.) to facilitate the communication and do not use it for any other marketing purpose 
            unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality 
            on our Site, your email address, mobile number, name or user name and message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s).
          </p>

          <h3>California Do Not Track Disclosures</h3>
          <p>Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection 
            of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services (e.g., browser do not 
            track signals). Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms.
          </p>


          <h2 id="2">WHERE AND WHEN IS INFORMATION COLLECTED?</h2>
          <h3>Online Form, Questionnaire or Chat Session</h3>
          <p>If you provide Personal Information in an online form to request a call-back, a personal assessment questionnaire or a chat session on the 
            Site, we may combine information collected during these online interactions with any other Personal Information that we have about you. 
            Whenever we combine information with your Personal Information (or PHI), we will treat it as your Personal Information (or PHI, as required).
          </p>

          <h3>OnTrak Program</h3>
          <p>For users that are eligible or enrolled in OnTrak, we may combine your Personal Information with (a) other information you share with us during 
            face-to-face visits or via electronic communications (via audio, interactive voice response, video, text or email, for example), (b) information 
            we obtain from or on behalf of health plans that offer the OnTrak Program as a plan benefit, (c) information from health and care providers who, 
            with your consent, share your Personal Information as part of your participation in the OnTrak Program or (d) Usage Information. We use this 
            consolidated information to help us understand the use and utilization of the OnTrak Program, and support a more personalized experience for you 
            on the Site and when communicating with your OnTrak coach. We also combine this information for internal operations such as operating and improving 
            the OnTrak Program, to contact you for customer service purposes, and to facilitate the delivery of messages that we believe are normal, expected 
            and welcomed by our eligible or enrolled OnTrak members. All of this information will be treated as PHI.
          </p>

          <h3>Non-Personal Information</h3>
          <p>We may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information to analyze trends, administer and monitor the use of the Site, and gather 
            general demographic information, personalize your experience using the Site and evaluate the OnTrak Program in general.
          </p>

          <h2 id="3">
          WHEN DO WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD-PARTIES?
          </h2>
          <p>We may share Non-Personal Information, such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties.  Further, we may share your Device Identifiers 
            with third parties along with data related to you and your activities.  We do not share your Personal Information with third parties with whom 
            we have marketing or other relationships for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

          <p><strong>When You Provide Information to or Receive Information from Third-Parties</strong>. You may be presented with an option on our Site to provide 
            information directly to third parties or give them access to it, or to receive information, including marketing offers, directly from or 
            on behalf of third parties. If you choose to do so, your Personal Information and other information may be disclosed to these third parties, 
            and all information you disclose will be subject to their privacy policies and practices, including third parties that are required to protect 
            your information as PHI under HIPAA.  Be advised that third parties may store, collect or otherwise have access to your information when 
            you interact with their Tracking Technologies, content, tools apps or ads on our Site or link to them from our Site. This may include using 
            third party tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or other third-party posting or content sharing tools and by so interacting you consent 
            to their privacy policies and practices. It may also include ordering or purchasing products from third parties through us where we indicate 
            that the third party rather than we are the seller. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties and, 
            therefore, you should review their privacy policies and practices before requesting information from or otherwise interacting with them 
            through our Site.  
          </p>

          <p><strong>Third-Parties Providing Services on our Behalf</strong>. We may use third-party vendors to perform certain services on behalf 
            of us or the Site, such as: (i) to assist us in Site operations; (ii) to manage a database of customer information; (iii) hosting the Site; 
            (iv) designing and/or operating the Site’s features; (v) tracking the Site’s activities and analytics; (vi) enabling us to send you special

            We may provide these vendors with access to user information, including Device Identifiers and Personal Information, to carry out the 
            services they are performing for you or for us. In all cases in which we share your Personal Information with a third party, we will 
            not authorize them to keep, disclose or use your information with others except for the purpose of providing the services we asked them to provide.  
          </p>
          
          <p>Third-party analytics and other service providers may set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device and they may otherwise 
            collect or have access to information about you, potentially including Personal Information, about you. We are not responsible for those 
            third-party technologies or activities arising out of them.  However, some may offer you certain choices regarding their practices. We are 
            not responsible for the effectiveness of or compliance with any third-parties’ opt-out options.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Administrative and Legal Reasons</strong>. We may access, use, preserve, transfer and disclose your information (including Device 
            Identifiers and Personal Information) to third parties: (i) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoenas, governmental requests or

            property or security of the Site or any third party; and/or (iv) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. 
            Further, we may use IP address or other Device Identifiers, to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with third parties such as copyright 
            owners, internet service providers, wireless service providers and/or law enforcement agencies, including disclosing such information to third-parties, 
            all in our discretion, subject to applicable law. Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you. 
          </p>

          <p><strong>Affiliates and Business Transfer</strong>. We may share your information, including your Device Identifiers and Personal Information, 
            Demographic Information and Usage Information with our parent, subsidiaries and affiliates.  We also reserve the right to disclose and transfer all 
            such information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Site or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a merger, 
            consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our interests and/or assets or other corporate change, including, during the course 
            of any due diligence process.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong>. California Civil Code § 1798.83 permits California residents who have supplied personal information 
            (as defined in the law) to us to, under certain circumstances, request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of personal

            direct marketing purposes, but if we were to elect to do so in the future, this law would apply to you.  Under this law, you may obtain the categories of 
            personal information shared by us and the names and addresses of all third parties that received personal information for their direct marketing purposes

            request, you would be asked to provide sufficient information for us to determine if this applies to you, attest to the fact that you are a California 
            resident and provide a current California address for our response.  To make such a request (limit one request per year), you would also be requested to 
            send an email to: <a href="mailto:privacy@stayontrak.com">privacy@stayontrak.com</a>, with “California Privacy Rights” as the subject line or mail us a letter

            we can tailor our services to your individual interests. As well, we may use third-parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve 
            information about the OnTrak Program across the Internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third-parties

          <p>This collection and re-targeting takes place both on our Site and on third-party websites that participate in the ad network, such as websites that 
            feature advertisements delivered by the ad network. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our outreach efforts. We and third-party 
            vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as a DoubleClick cookie) together 
            to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Site.

            Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver targeted content 
            and/or ads to you, which will affect this and other sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your
