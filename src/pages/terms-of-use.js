              send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice 
              to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.  But if no such information exists or if such information is not 
              current, then we have no obligation under this Section 5.A.  Your notice to us must be sent to: OnTrak, P.O. Box 3089, Santa Monica, CA  90408. For a period of 
              sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, we and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute or 
              Excluded Dispute, though nothing will require either you or Catasys to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and Catasys, 
              in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.

            <ol type="i">
            <li>
              <strong><u>Arbitration.</u></strong> If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 5.A within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either 
              you or we may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration in accordance with this Section 5.B.  If we cannot resolve an Excluded Dispute as set forth in Section 5.A 
              within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Excluded Dispute to formal arbitration only if you and our consent, in a 
              writing signed by you and an Officer or legal representative of ours, to have that Excluded Dispute subject to arbitration.  In such a case, (and only in such 
              a case), that Excluded Dispute will be deemed a “Dispute” for the remainder of this Section 5.B. <br /><br />

              Upon expiration of the applicable sixty-day period and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a Dispute will be resolved solely by binding 
              arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”). If the Dispute has a claimed 
              value of not more than $250,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not 
              less than fifteen (15) years experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the 
              proceedings in accordance with the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $250,000, 
              or if we elect in or sole discretion to bear the costs of arbitration in excess of those that would occur for a proceeding before a single neutral arbitrator, 
              then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three-member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will be chair of 
              the panel) selected by the two party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator or arbitration panel, 
              as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according to the applicable 
              law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award. If you and we do not both consent to the arbitration of an Excluded 
              Dispute as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Section 5.B(i), then this paragraph and the remainder of this Section 5.B will not apply 
              to the Excluded Dispute. <br /><br />

              If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of 
              the filing of a “demand for arbitration,” then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Sites Inc. 
              (“<strong>JAMS</strong>”) using JAMS’ streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer or legal 
              representative of ours consent to in writing. The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $250,000 threshold for the number of 
              arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above for the AAA arbitration will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or another 
              arbitration service.<br /><br />

              You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:<br /><br />

            </li> 

            <li><strong><u>Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution.</u></strong> In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the 
              terms of these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief.  However, WITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR 
              JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS 
              LIMITED. All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. If an 
              in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the “metropolitan statistical area” (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are 
              a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with 
              the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require us to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this 
              Section 5 to be enforceable, then we will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration, or to decline to do so and have the matter 
              resolved through the courts. Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. The arbitrator’s decision must consist of a written 
              statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision 
              and any award (if any) is based. Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the 
              parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.

            <strong><u>Injunctive Relief.</u></strong> The foregoing provisions of this Section 5 will not apply to any legal action taken by us to seek an injunction 
            or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Site, any Content, and/or our 
            intellectual property rights, our operations, and/or our products or services.

            or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.  But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator 
            selected pursuant to Section 5.B(i) holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 5.B to arbitrate will not apply 
            and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 5.G.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong><u>Federal and State Courts in Los Angeles.</u></strong> Except to the extent that arbitration is required in Section 5.B, and except as to the enforcement 
            of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute may only be instituted in state or federal court in the 
            County of Los Angeles. Accordingly, you and we consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.
